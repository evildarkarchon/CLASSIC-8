# Phase 2: Settings Persistence Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 focused on implementing a comprehensive YAML settings system with persistence support for the CLASSIC-8 application. This implementation provides an easy-to-use API for managing application settings with automatic caching and file watching capabilities.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Interfaces

#### `IYamlSettings` (`Classic.Core/Interfaces/IYamlSettings.cs`)
- High-level interface for accessing and modifying YAML settings
- Methods for Get/Set operations (sync and async)
- Support for checking setting existence
- Save and reload functionality
- Store path resolution

#### `ISettingsService` (`Classic.Core/Interfaces/ISettingsService.cs`)
- Strongly-typed access to application settings
- Provides a `ClassicSettings` property for easy access
- Methods for getting/setting individual settings
- Save and reload operations

### 2. Models and Enums

#### `YamlStore` (`Classic.Core/Enums/YamlStore.cs`)
- Enumeration defining different YAML configuration stores:
  - Main: Application metadata and defaults
  - Settings: User preferences
  - Ignore: Plugin ignore lists
  - Game: Game-specific configuration
  - GameLocal: User-specific game settings
  - Test: For unit testing

#### `ClassicSettings` (`Classic.Core/Models/Settings/ClassicSettings.cs`)
- Strongly-typed model representing application settings
- Properties for all UI settings:
  - ManagedGame
  - UpdateCheck, VRMode, FCXMode
  - SimplifyLogs, SoundOnCompletion
  - ScanGameFiles, ExcludeWarnings
  - UsePreReleases, UpdateSource
  - File paths (StagingModsPath, CustomScanPath, GameIniPath)

### 3. Infrastructure Implementation

#### `YamlSettings` (`Classic.Infrastructure/Configuration/YamlSettings.cs`)
- Comprehensive YAML settings management system
- Features:
  - Concurrent caching with `ConcurrentDictionary`
  - File watching for dynamic reload
  - Support for static vs. dynamic stores
  - Automatic creation of default files
  - Thread-safe operations
  - YamlDotNet integration for serialization

#### `SettingsService` (`Classic.Infrastructure/Configuration/SettingsService.cs`)
- Provides strongly-typed access to settings
- Automatic mapping between property names and YAML keys
- Caching of loaded settings
- Reflection-based property synchronization

### 4. UI Integration

#### Updated `MainWindowViewModel`
- Integrated with `ISettingsService` via dependency injection
- Settings loaded on startup in `LoadSettings()`
- Properties automatically save when changed
- Removed need for manual settings management

#### Dependency Injection Setup
- Updated `Program.cs` with full DI container configuration
- Added service registration in `ServiceCollectionExtensions`
- Updated `App.axaml.cs` to use DI for ViewModel creation

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Persistence
Settings are automatically saved when UI properties change, eliminating the need for explicit save operations.

### 2. Type Safety
Strongly-typed `ClassicSettings` model ensures compile-time type checking and IntelliSense support.

### 3. Default File Creation
The system automatically creates default YAML files with appropriate structure if they don't exist.

### 4. Flexible API
Supports both generic key-value access and strongly-typed model access, providing flexibility for different use cases.

### 5. Thread Safety
All operations are thread-safe using concurrent collections and proper locking mechanisms.

## Usage Examples

### Getting Settings
```csharp
// Using ISettingsService (recommended)
var managedGame = _settingsService.Settings.ManagedGame;

// Using IYamlSettings directly
var fcxMode = _yamlSettings.Get<bool>(YamlStore.Settings, "CLASSIC_Settings.FCX Mode");
```

### Setting Values
```csharp
// Using ISettingsService
_settingsService.Settings.VRMode = true;
await _settingsService.SaveAsync();

// Using IYamlSettings directly
_yamlSettings.Set(YamlStore.Settings, "CLASSIC_Settings.VR Mode", true);
await _yamlSettings.SaveAsync();
```

### In ViewModels
```csharp
// Properties automatically save on change
public bool FcxMode
{
    get => _fcxMode;
    set
    {
        this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref _fcxMode, value);
        _ = SaveSettings(); // Automatic save
    }
}
```

## File Structure

Settings are stored in YAML files at the following locations:
- `CLASSIC Settings.yaml` - User preferences (application root)
- `CLASSIC Ignore.yaml` - Plugin ignore lists (application root)
- `CLASSIC Data/databases/CLASSIC Main.yaml` - Application metadata
- `CLASSIC Data/databases/CLASSIC {Game}.yaml` - Game-specific data
- `CLASSIC Data/CLASSIC {Game} Local.yaml` - User's game-specific settings

## Next Steps

With settings persistence complete, the next priorities are:
1. Real Service Integration - Replace mock orchestrator with actual implementation
2. Progress and Notification System - User feedback during operations
3. Results Display System - Show scan results to users

## Benefits Achieved

1. **User Experience**: Settings are now persisted between application sessions
2. **Developer Experience**: Easy-to-use API with strong typing
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with proper abstractions
4. **Reliability**: Thread-safe operations with proper error handling
5. **Flexibility**: Supports both simple key-value and complex object storage
