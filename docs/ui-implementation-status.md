- Settings checkboxes (FCX Mode, Simplify Logs, Update Check, VR Mode, etc.)
- Update source selection dropdown
- Utility buttons (About, Help, Settings, etc.)

### File Backup Tab
- Sectioned backup operations for XSE, RESHADE, VULKAN, ENB
- Three-action pattern (Backup, Restore, Remove) for each category

### Articles Tab
- Resource link collection with proper data binding
- Grid layout for external resource buttons

## 🚧 Pending Implementation

### High Priority (Core Functionality)

#### 1. File Dialog Integration

### Low Priority (Polish and Enhancement)

#### 8. Advanced UI Features
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Requirements**:
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
- Drag-and-drop file support for crash logs
- Advanced filtering and search in results
- Theme customization options
- Window state persistence

#### 9. Papyrus Monitoring Integration
**Status**: Not present in current UI  
**Requirements**:
- Port Papyrus monitoring functionality from Python version
- Create monitoring dialog with statistics display
- Real-time log monitoring and analysis
- Integration with main scanning workflow

#### 10. Pastebin Integration
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Requirements**:
- Add Pastebin log fetching functionality
- URL validation and parsing
- Integration with main scanning workflow
- Error handling for network operations

## 🔧 Technical Debt and Improvements

### Code Quality
- Add comprehensive unit tests for ViewModels
- Implement proper exception handling throughout UI
- Add logging for all user interactions
- Code documentation and XML comments

### Performance
- Implement proper memory management for large scan results
- Add cancellation token support to all async operations
- Optimize UI updates during long-running operations
- Implement result data virtualization for large datasets

### Architecture
- Consider implementing proper dependency injection container
- Add configuration validation on startup
- Implement proper application lifecycle management
- Add proper disposal patterns for resources

## 📋 Implementation Priority Order

1. ✅ **File Dialog Integration** - ~~Required for basic functionality~~ **COMPLETED**
2. **Settings Persistence** - Essential for user experience
3. **Real Service Integration** - Core functionality requirement
4. **Progress and Notifications** - Important for user feedback
5. **Results Display System** - Needed for scan output
