## 📝 Key Differences from Python Version

1. **Architecture**
   - Uses template pattern for report formatting
   - Strongly typed models instead of dictionaries
   - Async/await pattern for file I/O

2. **Enhancements**
   - Support for multiple report formats (focused on Markdown)
   - Better separation of concerns with template system
   - Type safety with C# models

3. **Report Format**
   - Reports are generated in Markdown format for better readability
   - Uses markdown formatting (headers, lists, badges) instead of plain text
   - More structured output with proper sections

## 🔄 Migration Notes

When porting from Python:
- `yamldata` configuration → `CrashLogAnalysisResult` model
- String concatenation → `StringBuilder` for performance
- Direct file writing → Async file operations with `IFileSystem`
- Dictionary-based data → Strongly typed models
